## Test Instructions:
run npm install to install all the dependencies. Also in the config folder in config.js and enter your password in development. Also utilize workbench and add an sql file to create a database.

    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database_development;

    CREATE DATABASE database_development;

Then run the database. Afterwords go into your terminal run node server.js. Click on the server to populate the server. Open up another terminal and go into the seeders directory and run seeds.js to populate the data to insert into the artworks table. Go back to the app and enjoy. Click the "Add Artwork" button. User is able to create, view, update, delete artwork. Once all values are entered, click submit and populates that artwork back to the index page.

## Challenges:
As a group, we needed to figure out what to build. Once we came to an agreement, we had a bunch of ideas that were not fully completed. We wanted to create a user login and password so each user can enter their own artwork; a page that views all artwork; a page to view all artists; and a page that views each artwork blown up. If you check out my test branch you'll see what was created. 


Individually we all had our own challenges, but we all took part on what we needed to do to get this project functional, and complete. 


Also, adding another npm package that wasn't discussed or used in class was difficult because of time restraints trying to complete the project and reading those documents. 

Deploying from Heroku was another issue we came across. Kept getting errors trying to get it deployed.

## Future Developments:
- A Navbar with the title of the app along with other tabs with all the info I mentioned in the challenges. Maybe also create a tab where the user can also sell or buy artwork as well, chat and messaging features, linking to other social media accounts, and a message board to encourage artists community.
